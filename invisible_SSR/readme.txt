This model describes the situation when the request signals of the SSR system radar are not directly available on the receiver of the Control System. This can happen when there are some obstacles between the Control System receiver and the radar (i.e. mountains, buildings etc). Here accuracies of the Control System are examined in case of different initial errors like error in the reference aircraft position determination. The reference aircraft is the aircraft with ADS-B transponder and therefore the position of such aorcraft os known.
